`nahpu` (NAtural History Project Utilities) is a lightweight cross-platform field cataloging app for natural history field data collection. The goal of nahpu is to help scientists working in the field or at the collection to catalog their specimens digitally. It is aimed to run on mobile devices (iOS and Android) and major desktop operating system (macOS, Linux, and Windows).

Typically, scientists working on biological specimens for natural history collection use paper catalogs to record specimen data. The method requires entering the data manually into a spreadsheet to then being catalog and integrated into the natural history museum database. The task is tedious and is proned to data entry errors. It is also difficult to link the data recorded in the papers with other associated medias, such as photos, videos, and/or audio files of the associated species or their habitats. Often the data get lost when a project ended. `nahpu` will allow instant spreadsheet creation of the specimen data and easy management of their associated medias.

`nahpu` will feature cataloging forms for natural history and their associated medias. Different kinds of charts to show statistics of the projects, e.g. specimen recorded per sites, trapping success, and several other relevant statistics to track progress and trend of your project. It will include fields to enter environment data (e.g., temperature, moon phase, etc.) whenever relevant.

## Status of the code

`nahpu` development is still at the early stage. Expect a lot of code changes.
