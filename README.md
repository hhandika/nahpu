## Overview

`nahpu` (NAtural History Project Utilities, loosely named after greater Malay chevrotain, *Tragulus napu*) is a cross-platform cataloging app for natural history specimen collection. It leverages mobile revolution to better manage data collection in the field and beyond. It does not aim to replace museum database (at least not yet), but is more targeted to streamline data collection and curatorial processing of natural history specimens. Users can use `nahpu` as a standalone field catalog or to supplement conventional paper-based catalogs.

## Status of the Development

`nahpu` development is at an early stage. First working prototype is targeted for mmammalian and avian specimens. We welcome ideas and support for other taxon groups. Feel free to contact the maintainer of this project if you all interested.
