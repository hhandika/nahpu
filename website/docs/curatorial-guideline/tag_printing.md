This page contains information on generating specimen tags using NAHPU data.

## Advantages of printing specimen tags

- **Saves time in the field** Rather than writing out full specimen tags, which can easily take 10 or more minutes per tag, a faster alternative is to use small tags with identifiers such as a tissue number (e.g., “B-729113”) and field number (e.g., “JPO 7299”). Then, back in a museum, the users can print the final, complete tags for the specimens.
- **Neater and more standardized tags** Some people have the gift of neat handwriting, whereas others are less gifted. Printing tags ensures that all the tag data is easy to read!
- **Avoids errors from repetive, tedious task** Writing a detailed locality name with coordinates and elevational data can be tedious to write out dozens of times in the field. Human error is common. Using NAHPU, this information need only be entered once and can then be associated with each specimen via a dropdown site menu. If necessary, the locality details can also be easily updated within the app.
- **Allows for data cleanup phase** Before printing, it is easy to use a final spreadsheet to correct whacky coordinates, elevations, terminology errors, spelling, etc.

## Tag-printing workflow

- **Export specimen data from NAHPU as a .csv file**
- **Final data cleanup** Final spellcheck, correct other miscellaneous errors, organizing/combining/splitting data columns as necessary.
- **Upload spreadsheet to Entomolabels** With the [Entomolabels software](https://labels.entomo.pl/) (unfortunately, only available for Windows computers) and pre-designed tag templates, you can format the data on the specimen tag.
- **Export final tag pdfs for the front and back of tags** Combine the front-of-tag pdf and back-of-tag pdf, alternating front and back pages.
- **Use an auto-duplex printer to print the final tags**

## Equipment

- **Printer** To print tags, the NAHPU team has used the [Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3820](https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Inkjet/WorkForce-Pro-WF-3820-Wireless-All-in-One-Printer/p/C11CJ07201) with [DURABrite® Ultra instant-dry pigment ink](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DX9DNSJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). Using this printer, ink, and the paper shown below, we recently printed (spring 2024) over 1000 bird specimen tags for the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science.
- **Paper** We have used [100% cotton, acid-free paper](https://www.redrivercatalog.com/browse/aurora-art-white-250.html) with a weight of 250 gsm. Since this is a relatively thick and sturdy paper, we found that it was very helpful to flex the paper a bit prior to printing. Otherwise, the printer can have trouble flipping the page internally.
