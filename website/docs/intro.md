**_Rethinking Biodiversity Inventory in the Digital Age_**

NAHPU is a cross-platform field cataloging app designed for natural history collections. It‚Äôs a free, open-source project that supports major desktop and mobile operating systems. Current version supports mammal and bird specimens.

:::info
NAHPU is currently in beta. We are working on adding more features and support for other taxa. If you have any questions or interested to contribute to the app development, please contact [project maintainer](https://hhandika.com/contact.html).

## Key Features

- üì∏ **Digital asset management**: Associate digital assets, such as photos of specimens and habitats, with your collection records. Support adding photos for sites, specimens, and field notes.
- üê¶ **Multi-taxon support**: You can incorporate all the supported taxa in a single project, each with their own catalog format tailored specifically for that taxa.
- üåç **Write site once, use it everywhere**: Create a site profile with detailed information about the location, habitat, and unlimited number of coordinates. Associate it with multiple specimens, collecting events, and field notes.
- üìÖ **Record collecting events**: Keep track of your collecting activities by documenting detailed information about the collection date, method, efforts, and personnel involved. This can be associated with multiple specimens.
- üß¨ **Efficient tissue sample management**: Manage a large number of tissue samples efficiently and keep track of their collection date and time. The system supports barcode and QR code reading using the device‚Äôs camera for easy and accurate tracking.
- üìä **Real-time statistics**: Monitor your collecting activities and make informed decisions to manage tissue sampling in the face of tube shortages and prevent over-collection.
- üîÑ **Advanced share function**: Take advantage of the app‚Äôs advanced share function to share your data with collaborators or incorporate it as an automatic pipeline to the museum database.

## NAHPU's mission

### Simplify complex fieldwork üõ†Ô∏è

NAHPU is designed with genomic studies and remote fieldwork in mind. It simplifies associating digital assets, including specimen and habitat photographs, while efficiently managing a large number of tissue samples. We optimize NAHPU using high-performance programming languages and frameworks to ensure smooth operation across various devices, while minimizing battery usage. Our ongoing efforts focus on enhancing NAHPU‚Äôs performance and stability.

### Support responsible and reproducible field-based research ‚ù§Ô∏è

NAHPU enables you to record detailed information about the specimens you collect, including origin, collection date, sites, measurements, field personnel, collection method, and other relevant information. With real-time statistics, NAHPU assists you in monitoring your collecting activities and making informed decisions to prevent over-collection. Together, these features ensure responsible and reproducible fieldwork.

### Promote data sharing and collaboration ü§ù

NAHPU is developed to streamline efforts and foster collaboration. The app facilitates data sharing and collaboration among researchers by adhering to open standards. It allows you to create automatic pipeline to simplify data transfer from fieldwork to museum database. The current version partially supports the [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) standard and follows the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/). We aim to further enhance NAHPU‚Äôs compliance with these standards and principles.

### Accessible for everyone ‚ôøÔ∏è

NAHPU is a free, open-source app that supports major desktop and mobile platforms. It is designed for natural history collectors and researchers with priority for user-friendliness and accessibility. We leverage the [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) system to ensures an intuitive interface and visual appeal, while also accommodating people with disabilities. Our ongoing efforts include internationalization with multi-language and [locale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locale_(computer_software)) support. Join our diverse community of contributors in making NAHPU an inclusive and welcoming project for all. Feel free to use and contribute to the app!
