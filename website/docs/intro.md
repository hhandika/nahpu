## NAHPU's mission

### Simplify complex fieldwork üõ†Ô∏è

NAHPU is designed with genomic studies and remote fieldwork in mind. It simplifies associating digital assets, including specimen and habitat photographs, while efficiently managing a large number of tissue samples. We optimize NAHPU using high-performance programming languages and frameworks to ensure smooth operation across various devices, while minimizing battery usage. Our ongoing efforts focus on enhancing NAHPU‚Äôs performance and stability.

### Support responsible collecting ‚ù§Ô∏è

NAHPU allows you to record detailed information about the specimens you collect. It helps you track their origin, including collection date, location, habitat, measurements, field personnel, etc. Additionally, NAHPU supports recording the collector‚Äôs information and collection method. The app provides real-time statistics to assist you in monitoring your collecting activities and making informed decisions to prevent over-collection.

### Promote data sharing and collaboration ü§ù

NAHPU is developed to streamline efforts and foster collaboration. The app facilitates data sharing and collaboration among researchers by adhering to open standards. It allows you to create automatic pipeline to simplify data transfer from fieldwork to museum database. The current version partially supports the [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) standard and follows the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/). We aim to further enhance NAHPU‚Äôs compliance with these standards and principles.

### Accessible for everyone ‚ôøÔ∏è

NAHPU is a free, open-source app that supports major desktop and mobile platforms. It is designed for natural history collectors and researchers with priority for user-friendliness and accessibility. We leverage the [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) system to ensures an intuitive interface and visual appeal, while also accommodating people with disabilities. Our ongoing efforts include internationalization with multi-language and locale support. Join our diverse community of contributors in making NAHPU an inclusive and welcoming project for all. Feel free to use and contribute to the app! üåøüì±üåé
