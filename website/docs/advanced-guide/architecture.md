## Overview

NAHPU is a cross-platform application built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), a high-performance framework for building cross-platform application. Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which is optimized for building user interfaces. An approach with Flutter simplifies the development process and allows developers to build applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase. In the backend, NAHPU uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for local storage. Since early 2024, we have been working on adding more Rust code to the NAHPU codebase. Our main target is to rewrite the slowest parts of the codebase in Rust. Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, reliability, and safety. By integrating Rust with Flutter, we aim to improve the performance of the application and provide a more robust user experience.
