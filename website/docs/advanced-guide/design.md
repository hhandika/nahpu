## Overview

This document outlines the design principles that guide the development of NAHPU. The principles are intended to help developers make decisions that align with the project's goals and values.

## Design System

NAHPU uses the [Material Design](https://material.io/design) system as a foundation for its design. Material Design is a design language developed by Google and is well-integrated with Flutter, the framework used to build NAHPU. Whenever possible, we follow Material Design guidelines to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience across platforms. This approach simplifies the design process and helps developers focus on building features rather than designing UI components from scratch.
