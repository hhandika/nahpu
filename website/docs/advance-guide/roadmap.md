## Overview

We summarize the development priorities for 2024. Due to the nature of software development, these priorities are subject to change. We will update this roadmap as we make progress and as we learn more about the needs of our users. This roadmap is inspired by the [Flutter Roadmap](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Roadmap).

## 2024

NAHPU development focuses on three key areas: efficiency, reproducibility, and inclusivity.

### Efficiency

We are working on adding more Rust code to the NAHPU codebase. Our main target is to rewrite the slowest parts of the codebase in Rust, such as data compression and decompression.

### Reproducibility

The main focus is to fully implement the [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) standard and [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

### Inclusivity
