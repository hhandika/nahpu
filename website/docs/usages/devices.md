title: Device Requirements
---

The necessary equipment for using NAHPU will depend on your specific field site and budget constraints. We provide a list of common devices and accessories that are typically required, tailored to various field budgets. These recommendations stem from our hands-on experience in remote tropical field sites with limited access to electricity. Please note that you may need to customize this list to better fit your unique field conditions

## Low-budget Option

- **A smartphone**. You can start by using your own smartphone. The NAHPU UI is designed to adapt to small screens.

- **Data Backup Solution**. You can use a 16 Gb flash for data backup. It should be sufficient for multiple backups. Our four-month fieldwork experience demonstrated that a database containing 230 high-resolution images used approximately 820 Mb of storage space.

- **A power bank**. Depending on the length of the fieldwork and your access to electricity, you may need a power bank to re-charge the device. Our experience using iPad Mini 6, a single charge can last at least for five days with limited camera usage and screen brightness, and was strictly used for data collection.

- **A usb-c or lightning to usb adapter**. You can use this adapter to connect your flash drive to your smartphone. Some flash drives have a usb-c connector. If you are using a recent Android or iPhone, you may not need this adapter.

## Medium-budget to High-budget Option

- **A tablet**. We recommend using an iPad Mini. You can also get a bigger iPad. Keep in mind that the iPad Mini tends to have smaller battery capacity than a bigger iPad, while still having the same battery life. It allows more recharge for the same power bank capacity.

- **An external wireless keyboard**. It helps you to type faster and avoid touching the screen with dirty hands.

- **A usb-c flash drive**. Get a high quality flash drives with USB-C connector. Some of these flash drives are waterproof.

- **A power bank**. We recommend using a 20,000 to 25,000 mAH power bank. It is usually airline approved. The weight to capacity ratio is also good. It is also good to have a power bank with a USB-C connector. It often allows to fast charging the devices. It also allows you to charge the power bank faster. For example, at the [Esseltyn's lab](https://esselstyn.github.io/), in fieldwork in remote mountains in Indonesia, we sometimes have guides that can bring the power bank to the nearest village to charge it. A 25,000 mAH power bank with USB-C connector can be charged to full in 4 hours, while a 20,000 mAH power bank with micro-USB connector can take 8 hours or more to charge to full.

- **Multi-output wall charger**. It allows you to charge multiple devices at once. We recommend at least 65W chargers. Some brands has travel compatible, featuring switchable plugs.

## Power Bank Capacity and Number of Charges

### Power Bank Capacity (mAh)

The capacity of a power bank is measured in milliampere-hours (mAh). It represents the amount of charge the power bank can store. Essentially, the higher the mAh rating, the more energy the power bank can hold.

### Calculating Number of Charges

To estimate the number of charges you can obtain from a power bank:

#### Identify Your Device’s Battery Capacity

First, determine your device’s battery capacity. This information is usually specified in milliampere-hours (mAh). For example, the iPad Mini 6 has a battery capacity of 5,124 mAh.

#### Factor in Efficiency

Power banks are not 100% efficient; some energy is lost during the charging process. INUI power banks, for example, recommend industry standard efficiency of 60% (check out FAQ [here](https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Charging-25000mAh-Ultimate-Compatible/dp/B08VDJP7WN/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.53831hvEg6BgPzbrb5I41tInlx-EH5hxvYNZLyLitOD4lyvpIwIoJoUmqSFJaVveExcyJ6TiTAjlJ92U55OT1Nd0sdrrEdDu-zFijYYFJlNFAAdcEPg-eU3bat1W70Y2wp83hE6iWVlwK0Rp4UaDSXuFstsFp_YO1qgpKuyCqqnljlPqHqKJycxdvKVlhGgz07IlBu3xocSCS-nWZ2DfH-WLas9wzITLcYuNZY3Fhqk.sIBitUxLYysI0KsbS_zpMyAv9At1XZ60iwVRFPFJXUY&dib_tag=se&keywords=inui&qid=1712187440&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)). Other power banks may have different efficiency ratings.

The number of charges can be calculated using the following formula:

```math
Number of charges = (Power Bank Capacity (mAh) × Efficiency)​ ÷ Device Battery Capacity (mAh)
```

For example, to calculate the number of charges for a 25,000 mAh power bank with 60% efficiency charging an iPad Mini 6 with a 5,124 mAh battery:

```math
Number of charges = (25,000 mAh × 0.6) ÷ 5,124 mAh = 2.9 charges
```

## Strategies to manage devices battery life

- **Screen Brightness**: Lower the screen brightness or enable the auto-brightness feature. A dimmer screen consumes less power.

- **Airplane Mode and Low Power Mode**:
  - Airplane Mode: Enable it to disable all wireless connections (Wi-Fi, cellular data, Bluetooth) when not in use.
  - Low Power Mode: Activate this mode on your device to optimize battery usage.
  
- **Power Off After Use**:
  - Android Devices: Turning off the device completely when not in use can be beneficial for battery conservation.
  - iPhone and iPad: Apple devices are generally good at managing battery usage, you may not need to power them off.

- **Disable Unnecessary Features**:
  - Bluetooth: Turn it off when not actively using external devices (e.g., keyboards).
  - Location Services: Limit other apps’ access to your location, as constant tracking drains the battery. NAHPU only uses location services when you generate a coordinate for a site using the device’s GPS.
  - Cellular Data: If your devices supports cellular data access, consider disabling it to save power.
