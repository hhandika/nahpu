## Creating a new project

To create a new project, use the `+` button in the bottom right corner of the home screen. You will be prompted to enter a project name, a project description, and main catalog format.

- **The project name** should be short and descriptive
- **The project description** should be a few sentences explaining the purpose of the project.
- **The main catalog format** is the format of the catalog that will be used to generate the specimen catalog pages. You can change this later. You can also mix different catalog format types in the same project.

## Getting to know the dashboard

After you create a project, you will proceed to the project dashboard. The dashboard is divided into four main panels:

- **Project overview** - This panel provides a quick overview of the project. It includes the project name, description, [principal investigator](./projects#principal-investigator), location, start date, end date, database creation date and last access date.
- **Personnel** - This panel lists all the personnel associated with the project. You can add more personnel by clicking the `[+ Add personnel]` button in the bottom of the panel.
- **Taxon registry** - This panel lists all the taxa registered in the database. You can add more taxa by clicking the `[+ Add taxon]` button in the bottom of the panel. You can also import taxa from a csv file by clicking the `[Import from file]` button.
- **Record statistics** - Graph showing real-time statistics of the number of records in the project.

## Updating Project info

You can add more information about the project by clicking the `pencil` button in the bottom right of the project overview.

## Deleting Projects

We deliberately make it difficult to delete a project. If you are sure you want to delete a project, delete all the associated records with the project first by following all the steps below:

1. Go to the project dashboard
2. Click the narrative button in the bottom navigation bar. Use the menu button (three dot icon) in the top right corner to select `Delete all records`.
3. Repeat step 2 for `Specimen Records`, `Collecting Events`, and `Site Records`. It requires the same exact order to delete the records.
4. Go back to the project dashboard and delete all the listed personnel.
5. Delete the project using the delete button in the menu drawer.

## Creating Reports

NAHPU provides a few options for creating reports.

- **Species count** - It will generate a report of the number of specimen for each species in the project.
- **Media Data** - It will generate a report of all the media files and their metadata in the project.

## Exporting Records

NAHPU export options:

- **Bundle records** - This option will export all the records, including media, in the project as a single zip file.
- **Export records** - This option provide export for each record type in the project. You have options to export Comma-delimited (.csv) or Tab-delimited (.tsv) files.
- **Export pdf** - This option will export each record type as a pdf file.

## Terminology

### Principal Investigator

The principal investigator is the person who is responsible for the project.
