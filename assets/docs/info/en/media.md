Media stores the images, audio, and video associated with a project record. Use `Add` to import a file or, where the device supports it, to take a photo or video or record audio.

Edit the file name, caption, tag, and photographer so another person can tell what the file shows. The category follows the file type, and capture date, camera, and lens details are read from the file’s own metadata when it carries any.

## Exporting media

Use `Export` on a media item to save one file, with options to convert it to JPEG, PNG, or WebP and to resize it. To save several files at once, open the media gallery, turn on selection, and select `Export`. That writes one TAR.GZ or ZIP archive, with the images converted and resized together and audio and video copied unchanged.

## Darwin Core context

Media attached to a specimen is exported alongside the occurrence as an Audiovisual Core `ac:Media` record: the caption or file name becomes the title, the capture date the creation date, and the photographer the creator. In tabular exports the media fields map to Dublin Core terms such as `dcterms:title`, `dcterms:created`, `dcterms:type`, and `dcterms:identifier`.
