Associated data connects a record to supporting links and non-media files, such as accession references, datasets, permits, protocols, sequence records, or documents.

Choose the data type that describes the relationship, add a name, description, and date, and provide a stable URI or a managed file. Use Media instead for images, audio, and video so audiovisual metadata is recorded consistently. Verify every link or file after adding it.

## Darwin Core context

Associated data has no Darwin Core class of its own. Tabular exports map these records to Dublin Core terms: the name to `dcterms:title`, the data type to `dcterms:type`, the description to `dcterms:description`, the date to `dcterms:created`, and the URI to `dcterms:identifier`.
